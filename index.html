        <h2>Where would you go?</h2>
        <p>A vacation I would love to take is to Tokyo, Japan. I planned this trip because I really enjoy anime, art, food, reading, and shopping. First, I would like to visit the Ginza Six shopping complex, especially the Ginza Tsutaya Bookstore (Public interest incorporated foundation Tokyo Metropolitan Foundation “TSUNAGARI”, 2021). Next, I would experience Miraikan, the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation - including the Explore the Frontiers exhibition and the Dome theatre (Miraikan, 2025). Finally, I would like to explore Akihabara. It is often called “Electric Town” because of the immense amount of technology sold there. Akihabara is the hub for Japanese subcultures, featuring anime, video games, manga, cosplay, and pop idols. </p>

        <h2>What would you do?</h2>
        <p>While visiting Akihabara, I would love to spend a day at Silk Hat Akihabara Game Centre, recently opened and with nine full floors of various arcade games (Team, 2025). It would be hard to choose what to play. An activity that I would greatly enjoy while visiting Tokyo, Japan, would be a soba noodle-making class. While I don’t regularly eat soba noodles, there is a food cart that I like that uses soba noodles for their dish; however, they do not have a regular restaurant, and I’d love to be able to make the noodles from scratch.</p>

        <h2>What would you eat?</h2>
        <p> Watching anime, there have been times when the animators drew the food looking so amazing that I was jealous I couldn’t have it. While on this vacation, I would try to remedy some of this food jealousy. Here are a few specifics I want to try during my trip to Tokyo: </p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>An authentic bowl of ramen</li>
                <li>Chicken katsu</li>
                <li>Chocolate-filled Taiyaki</li>
            </ul>
